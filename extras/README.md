# Image to Video Conversion

1. Organizing Image Paths (`image_paths.py`)  

    The script scans a specified folder containing images, sorts them based on episode and step numbers (extracted from the filenames) and saves the sorted paths into a CSV file.

    **Why this approach?:**  
        For this project, the image set can quickly grow to hundreds of thousands of files. Accessing and organizing them directly through the filesystem would be inefficient.
        Instead, we create a CSV with all the image paths, which only takes a few seconds to generate. This way, the images are quickly accessible for further processing.  
   
    **How to use:**  
        Provide the path to the folder containing the images.
        Run the script, which will output a CSV file (`image_paths.csv`) with the sorted image paths.  

2. Creating Video from Images (`images_to_video.py`)
    
    This script takes the `image_paths.csv` file generated by the first script, loads the images and combines them into a video. It resizes each image to fit the video resolution and overlays the episode and step information as text.
   
    **Performance:**  
        The script can process around 40,000 images per minute, allowing it to handle large volumes of images in a short amount of time.
   
    **How to use:**  
        Ensure you have a image_paths.csv file with the sorted image paths.
        Run the script to generate a video (default output file: `output.mp4`).
  
***Note: The scripts are optimized for the default frame size (84x84) specified in the mission XML.***
